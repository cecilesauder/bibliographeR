## Overview

Package with a shiny app

You can see the project [here](https://github.com/propan2one/BibliographeR)

For the moment, the Shiny App doesn't work, I'm working on it and you probably can test it around july 22... 

Some (really messy) code (that we use to our useR!2019 lightning talk) is available [here](https://github.com/propan2one/BibliographeR/blob/master/results/bazar_bibliographeR/oyster_example.Rmd)




## Installation 

``` r
# install.packages('devtools')
devtools::install_github('cecilesauder/bibliographeR')
```

## Shiny app online

If you don't want to install the package but just to test the application, it is deployed [here](https://cecilesauder.shiny
apps.io/bibliographer).
